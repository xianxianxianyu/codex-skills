## What is This?

A Claude Code skill that generates **detailed, engineer-focused Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)** designed to work seamlessly with AI task breakdown tools like Taskmaster.

Think of it as your AI product manager that asks the right questions, writes comprehensive specs, and sets you up for successful implementation.

## Why You Might Want This

### The Problem

You have an idea for a feature or product, but:
- Writing comprehensive PRDs takes hours
- You're not sure what details to include
- You want to use AI task breakdown tools (like Taskmaster) but they need detailed requirements
- Vague specs lead to vague tasks, which lead to poor implementations

### The Solution

This skill:
1. **Asks 12+ detailed questions** to extract everything from your brain
2. **Generates a comprehensive PRD** with all the sections engineers need
3. **Sets up taskmaster integration** with proper directory structure
4. **Validates quality** with automated checks (13 different validations)
5. **Suggests task breakdowns** with complexity estimates and dependencies

**Result:** You go from "I have an idea" to "I have a complete, validated PRD ready for AI task generation" in minutes.

## Installation

This skill works with **Claude Code CLI** and **Codex** (VS Code extension). Choose your tool below:

### Option A: Claude Code CLI (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Claude Code CLI installed ([installation guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/installation))
- Git

**Install the skill:**

```bash
# Clone to your Claude Code skills directory
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/anombyte93/prd-taskmaster.git
```

**Verify installation:**

```bash
# Start Claude Code in any project
claude

# In the chat, type:
# "I want a PRD for adding dark mode"
```

Claude Code should recognize the skill and activate it automatically!

**Troubleshooting:**
- If skill doesn't activate, check it's in `~/.claude/skills/prd-taskmaster/`
- Verify `SKILL.md` exists in that directory
- Try restarting Claude Code
- Check skill is enabled: Look for the skill description when typing "/help" or similar commands

---

### Option B: Codex (Untested)

**Prerequisites:**
- Codex ([see](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/README.md))
- Git

**Install the skill:**

```bash
# Clone to where you want to run codex
cd ~/<wherever>
git clone https://github.com/anombyte93/prd-taskmaster.git
cd prd-taskmaster
```

**Configure Codex to find the skill:**

1. Run Codex in the `prd-taskmaster` directory
2. Initialize Codex: `/init`
3. Codex will read `SKILL.md` and understand how to generate PRDs

**Verify installation:**

Ask Codex:
```
What would you do if I told you to generate a PRD?
```

Confirm it outputs something similar to the workflow described in this README.

**Using the generated codex.md:**

When the skill generates a PRD for your project, it will ask if you're using Codex:
- If yes: Creates both `CLAUDE.md` and `codex.md` in your project root
- If no: Creates only `CLAUDE.md`

The `codex.md` file guides Codex to follow TDD workflow, use agents, and maintain quality gates throughout development.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check you cloned to the correct directory
- Check you ran Codex in the `prd-taskmaster` directory
- Run `/init` to ensure Codex reads `SKILL.md`
- Verify `SKILL.md` exists in the directory

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Usage

Once installed, just tell Claude/Codex you want a PRD:

```
"I want a PRD for [your feature/product]"
```

**Activation phrases:**
- "I want a PRD for adding two-factor authentication"
- "Create product requirements for a user dashboard"
- "Write a PRD for integrating with Stripe payments"
- "Generate requirements for building a dark mode feature"

### What Happens Next

The skill will:

1. **Ask you 12+ detailed questions**
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who's the target user?
   - What are success metrics?
   - What's the tech stack?
   - Any constraints or dependencies?

2. **Analyze your codebase** (if applicable)
   - Scans for related code
   - Identifies integration points
   - References existing patterns

3. **Generate a comprehensive PRD**
   - All essential sections included
   - Task breakdown hints
   - Complexity estimates

4. **Set up taskmaster integration**
   - Creates `.taskmaster/` directory
   - Places PRD in correct location
   - Updates `.gitignore`

5. **Validate everything**
   - 13 automated quality checks
   - Warns about vague language
   - Scores PRD quality

6. **Show you next steps**
   - Summary of what was created
   - Suggestions for taskmaster usage
   - Open questions to address

### First-Time Tips

**Be detailed in your answers!** The more context you provide, the better the PRD.

**Example good answer:**
> "We need 2FA because we're seeing 150 security incidents per month from compromised accounts. Target users are enterprise customers who require SOC2 compliance. Success = reduce incidents to <10/month and meet SOC2 requirements."

**Example too-vague answer:**
> "We need 2FA for security."

**Don't worry about perfect answers** - the skill will ask follow-ups if needed!

### 馃 CLAUDE.md / codex.md - TDD Workflow Guide

Generates a comprehensive workflow file in your project root that guides Claude Code/Codex to:

- **Follow TDD by default** - Write tests first, then implementation
- **Use blind-validator agent** - Validate against PRD without seeing code
- **Execute parallel tasks** - Run independent tasks simultaneously
- **Leverage agents** - For validation, exploration, and context optimization
- **Enforce quality gates** - Automated validation before marking tasks complete
- **Follow taskmaster best practices** - Optimal workflow for AI-assisted development

**Key sections:**
- TDD workflow (RED 鈫?GREEN 鈫?REFACTOR cycle)
- Agent usage guidelines (when/how to use each agent type)
- Parallel task execution strategies
- Validation & quality gates
- Tool preferences & context optimization
- Project-specific configuration (tech stack, test commands, etc.)

**File naming:**
- **Claude Code:** Creates `CLAUDE.md` (read automatically by Claude Code)
- **Codex:** Creates `codex.md` (read by Codex when initialized with `/init`)
- The skill will ask which tool you're using and create the appropriate file(s)
- Both files have identical content
- Includes instructions for keeping them in sync if you use both tools

This ensures consistent, high-quality development across your entire project!

### 鉁?Quality Validation

13 automated checks ensure:
- All required sections are present
- Requirements are testable (not vague)
- Success metrics are SMART
- Technical considerations address architecture

## How It Works

### The 8-Step Workflow

1. **Discovery** - Ask comprehensive questions
2. **Environment Check** - Look for existing taskmaster setup
3. **Codebase Analysis** - Understand existing code (if applicable)
4. **PRD Generation** - Write comprehensive requirements
5. **Directory Setup** - Create `.taskmaster/` structure
6. **Validation** - Run 13 quality checks
7. **Task Hints** - Suggest breakdowns and dependencies
8. **Presentation** - Show summary and next steps

## Advanced Usage

### Using with Taskmaster

The skill now **automatically detects and prefers MCP** over CLI for seamless integration!

#### Automatic Detection (Recommended)

The skill will automatically:
1. **Detect MCP Task-Master-AI** (if installed in Claude Code)
2. **Fallback to CLI** (if MCP not available but CLI is installed)
3. **Provide installation instructions** (if neither is available)

**With MCP (PREFERRED):**
- 鉁?Seamless integration with direct function calls
- 鉁?No shell dependency
- 鉁?Automatic task initialization, parsing, and expansion
- 鉁?Query tasks using MCP tools directly in Claude Code

The skill will automatically:
- Initialize taskmaster project structure
- Parse your PRD to generate tasks
- Expand all tasks into subtasks
- No manual CLI commands needed!

**With CLI (Fallback):**
```bash
# After PRD is generated:
npm install -g task-master-ai
cd your-project
taskmaster init
taskmaster parse-prd --input .taskmaster/docs/prd.md
taskmaster expand-all --research
taskmaster next-task  # Begin implementation
```

**Without Taskmaster:**
- Skill generates manual task files in `.taskmaster/tasks/`
- Provides installation instructions for MCP or CLI
- You can still follow the PRD and task files manually

### Customizing Templates

Edit templates in `templates/` directory:
- `taskmaster-prd-comprehensive.md` - Full template
- `taskmaster-prd-minimal.md` - Quick template

### Manual Validation

Use the validation checklist:
```bash
cat reference/validation-checklist.md
```

**Please open an issue!** Your real-world usage will make this better.

## Why Share This?

### The Philosophy

> "Planning is 95% of the work. A comprehensive, validated PRD is the foundation of successful implementation."

If you're using AI to help build software, the **quality of your requirements** directly impacts the **quality of your results**.

This skill codifies lessons learned from:
- Writing PRDs manually (painful)
- Using AI task breakdown tools (needs good input)
- Iterating on what makes a "good enough" PRD
- Automating the boring parts

### The Hope

Maybe this helps you:
- Save time on PRD writing
- Improve your planning process
- Get better results from AI task tools
- Ship features more successfully

If it does, great! If not, no worries - maybe you'll fork it and make it better for your needs.

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need Taskmaster to use this?

**A:** No. The PRD is useful on its own. Taskmaster integration is optional.

### Q: Will this work for my project?

**A:** Probably? It's designed for web/API projects but adaptable. Try it and see!

### Q: Can I modify the templates?

**A:** Absolutely! That's encouraged. Edit templates to match your needs.

### Q: What if the PRD quality validation fails?

**A:** The skill will warn you about issues. You can still use the PRD - validation is guidance, not enforcement.

### Q: How long does it take?

**A:** 5-15 minutes depending on how detailed your answers are.

### Q: Is this better than writing PRDs manually?

**A:** Different trade-off. Faster and more comprehensive, but less customized. Your call!
