> **Taskmaster-managed project with TDD-first development**

## Project Overview

This project uses **Taskmaster** for AI-assisted task breakdown and follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach by default.

**Key Documents:**
- PRD: `.taskmaster/docs/prd.md` - Product requirements
- Tasks: `.taskmaster/tasks/` - AI-generated task breakdown
- Architecture: `.taskmaster/docs/architecture.md` - System design (if applicable)

## Codex Instructions

Codex reads `codex.md` when present. Keep this file up to date with workflow expectations.

## Development Workflow (Mandatory TDD)

RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

1. Write a failing test that defines the desired behavior
2. Implement the minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

## Taskmaster Workflow

1. Ensure `.taskmaster/docs/prd.md` is up to date
2. Run `taskmaster init` (first time only)
3. Run `taskmaster generate` to produce tasks
4. Implement tasks one-by-one, keeping tests green
