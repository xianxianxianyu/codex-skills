# Project: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> **Taskmaster-Managed Project with TDD-First Development**

## Project Overview

This project uses **taskmaster** for AI-assisted task breakdown and follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach by default.

**Key Documents:**
- PRD: `.taskmaster/docs/prd.md` - Comprehensive product requirements
- Tasks: `.taskmaster/tasks/` - AI-generated task breakdown
- Architecture: `.taskmaster/docs/architecture.md` - System design (if applicable)

**Development Philosophy:**
> "Planning is 95% of the work. Tests are 95% of planning. Write tests first, implement second, validate always."

## Tool-Specific Setup

### Using with Claude Code CLI

This file is named `CLAUDE.md` and will be automatically read by Claude Code when working in this project directory.

**No additional setup needed!** Claude Code reads this file by default.

### Using with Codex

If you're using Codex instead of Claude Code, you should copy this file to `codex.md`:

```bash
# From your project root:
cp CLAUDE.md codex.md
```

**Why both files?**
- Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` by default
- Codex reads `codex.md` by default (when initialized with `/init`)
- Both files should have identical content
- Update both when making workflow changes

**Keeping them in sync:**
```bash
# After updating CLAUDE.md:
cp CLAUDE.md codex.md
git add CLAUDE.md codex.md
git commit -m "Update workflow documentation"
```

---

## Development Workflow: TDD-First Approach

### MANDATORY: Test-Driven Development

**Every feature, every task, every change follows TDD:**

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
```

1. **RED** - Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **GREEN** - Implement minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### TDD Cycle in Practice

**For each task:**

```bash
# 1. RED: Write failing test first
# Example: For a user authentication feature
write_test("test_user_can_login_with_valid_credentials")
run_tests()  # Should FAIL (red)

# 2. GREEN: Implement minimal code
implement_feature("user_login")
run_tests()  # Should PASS (green)

# 3. REFACTOR: Improve code quality
refactor_code("improve_login_performance")
run_tests()  # Should still PASS (green)

# 4. VALIDATE: Use blind-validator agent
/blind-validator .taskmaster/docs/prd.md
```

### Never Skip Tests

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT implement features without tests. If you catch yourself:
- Writing implementation code before tests → STOP
- Skipping tests "to move faster" → STOP
- Planning to "add tests later" → STOP

**Always write tests first.**

## Taskmaster Integration

### Working with Taskmaster Tasks

**Task Location:** `.taskmaster/tasks/`

**Reading Tasks:**
```bash
# View all tasks
taskmaster list

# View specific task
taskmaster show <task-id>

# View task dependencies
taskmaster deps <task-id>
```

**Task Workflow:**

1. **Read the task** - Understand requirements, acceptance criteria, dependencies
2. **Read the PRD** - Reference relevant PRD sections
3. **Write tests** - Based on acceptance criteria
4. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass tests
5. **Validate** - Use blind-validator agent
6. **Mark complete** - Only when tests pass and validation succeeds

### Task Dependencies

**Before starting a task:**
- Check dependencies: `taskmaster deps <task-id>`
- Ensure dependent tasks are complete
- If blocked, work on independent tasks in parallel

**Parallel vs Sequential Tasks:**

✅ **Parallel** (can run simultaneously):
```
Task A: Implement user model
Task B: Implement product model
Task C: Design authentication flow
```

❌ **Sequential** (must run in order):
```
Task 1: Create database schema → Task 2: Implement models → Task 3: Write API endpoints
```

### Marking Tasks Complete

**Only mark complete when:**
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Blind-validator agent confirms compliance with PRD
- ✅ Acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Code is refactored and clean
- ✅ Documentation updated (if required)

```bash
# After validation passes:
taskmaster complete <task-id>
```

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Agents

**Use agents to:**
- **Reduce main context consumption** - Large codebases, extensive searches
- **Validate independently** - Blind validation without implementation details
- **Parallelize research** - Multiple exploration paths simultaneously
- **Specialized analysis** - Deep dives into specific areas

**Don't use agents for:**
- Simple file reads (use Read tool directly)
- Quick searches (use Grep/Glob directly)
- Single-step tasks (overhead not worth it)

### Agent Types for Taskmaster Workflow

#### 1. Blind-Validator Agent

**Purpose:** Validate implementation against PRD without seeing code

**When to use:**
- After implementing a feature
- Before marking task complete
- When you want unbiased validation

**How to use:**
```bash
# After implementation:
/blind-validator .taskmaster/docs/prd.md
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Requirements met per PRD
- ✅ Acceptance criteria satisfied
- ✅ No deviation from spec
- ✅ Edge cases handled

#### 2. Explore Agent

**Purpose:** Fast codebase exploration for understanding context

**When to use:**
- Starting a new task in unfamiliar codebase
- Understanding integration points
- Finding related code patterns

**How to use:**
```bash
# Use Task tool with Explore agent
# "Explore authentication implementation patterns in the codebase"
```

**Thoroughness levels:**
- `quick` - Basic search (< 30 seconds)
- `medium` - Moderate exploration (1-2 minutes)
- `very thorough` - Comprehensive analysis (3-5 minutes)

#### 3. General-Purpose Agent

**Purpose:** Complex multi-step research and analysis

**When to use:**
- Multi-step research tasks
- Complex codebase analysis
- When single search won't suffice

**How to use:**
```bash
# Use Task tool with general-purpose agent
# "Analyze how error handling works across the API layer"
```

#### 4. Research Squadron (Parallel Agents)

**Purpose:** Deploy multiple agents for comprehensive exploration

**When to use:**
- Need to explore multiple areas simultaneously
- Want comprehensive coverage quickly
- Starting work on large feature

**How to use:**
```bash
/agents:research-squadron "authentication patterns"
```

### Agent Best Practices

1. **Use agents proactively** - Don't wait to be blocked
2. **Specify thoroughness** - Match effort to task complexity
3. **Trust agent output** - Agents are specialized, their results are reliable
4. **Parallelize when possible** - Launch multiple agents in single message
5. **Review agent reports** - Synthesize findings before implementing

## Parallel Task Execution

### Identifying Independent Tasks

**Independent tasks can run in parallel:**

✅ **Example:**
```
- Task A: Implement user authentication
- Task B: Implement product catalog
- Task C: Set up CI/CD pipeline
```

These are independent - work on them concurrently.

❌ **Dependent tasks must be sequential:**
```
- Task 1: Design database schema
- Task 2: Implement models (depends on Task 1)
- Task 3: Write API (depends on Task 2)
```

### Using TodoWrite for Parallel Work

**Track multiple concurrent tasks:**

```markdown
1. [in_progress] Implement user model with tests
2. [in_progress] Implement product model with tests
3. [pending] Set up authentication API
4. [pending] Write integration tests
```

**Only ONE task should be `in_progress` at a time unless:**
- Tasks are truly independent
- You're using agents for some tasks
- Parallel tool calls are being executed

### Parallel Tool Calls

**Execute multiple tools simultaneously when independent:**

```bash
# Good: Independent reads
Read file_a.py
Read file_b.py
Read file_c.py

# Good: Independent searches
Grep "pattern_a"
Grep "pattern_b"
Glob "*.tsx"

# Bad: Dependent operations
Read schema.sql
Write model.py (depends on schema)
```

**Always parallelize when possible** - faster execution, better efficiency.

## Validation & Quality Gates

### Continuous Validation

**At every step:**

1. **Before implementation** - Write tests (red)
2. **During implementation** - Run tests frequently
3. **After implementation** - All tests pass (green)
4. **Before task completion** - Blind-validator agent
5. **Before commit** - Full test suite passes

### Quality Checklist

**For each task, verify:**

- [ ] Tests written first (TDD)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] PRD requirements satisfied
- [ ] Blind-validator passes
- [ ] Code is refactored and clean
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Ready for code review

### Using Blind-Validator

**Purpose:** Validate against requirements WITHOUT seeing implementation details

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents implementation bias
- Ensures objective validation
- Catches requirement gaps
- Verifies acceptance criteria

**How to use:**
```bash
# After implementing a feature:
/blind-validator .taskmaster/docs/prd.md

# Agent will:
# 1. Read the PRD requirements
# 2. Test the implementation (without reading code)
# 3. Verify acceptance criteria
# 4. Report pass/fail with details
```

**Only mark task complete after blind-validator passes.**

## Tool Preferences & Guidelines

### When to Use Each Tool

#### Task Tool (Agents)

**Use for:**
- Large codebase exploration
- Multi-step research
- Validation (blind-validator)
- Parallel exploration (research-squadron)
- Complex analysis requiring multiple steps

**Don't use for:**
- Simple file reads
- Single grep/glob patterns
- Straightforward implementations

#### Direct Tools (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash)

**Use for:**
- Reading specific known files
- Searching for specific patterns
- Implementing code changes
- Running tests
- Quick verifications

#### Parallel Tool Calls

**Always use when:**
- Reading multiple independent files
- Searching multiple patterns
- Running independent commands
- No dependencies between operations

### Context Optimization

**Strategies:**

1. **Use agents for exploration** - Keep main context for implementation
2. **Read files once** - Cache information, don't re-read
3. **Use PROJECT_INDEX.json** - If available, leverage it
4. **Minimize context** - Only read what's needed
5. **Agent parallelization** - Multiple agents = distributed context

**Example efficient workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Use Explore agent to understand codebase (saves main context)
Task: "Find authentication patterns" (Explore agent)

# 2. Synthesize findings in main context (minimal)
# 3. Write tests (main context)
# 4. Implement feature (main context)
# 5. Use blind-validator to validate (saves main context)
/blind-validator .taskmaster/docs/prd.md
```

## Commit & Version Control

### Commit Standards

**Follow git best practices:**

1. **Never commit untested code** (from CLAUDE.md rules)
2. **Stay on feature branch** until work complete
3. **Write descriptive commit messages**
4. **Include test results in commit message** (if significant)

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

<detailed description>

Tests: <test results>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
