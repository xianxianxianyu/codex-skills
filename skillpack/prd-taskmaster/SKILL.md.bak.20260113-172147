# PRD Generator for TaskMaster v2.0

Smart PRD generation system that detects existing PRDs and offers flexible workflows. Primarily generates comprehensive, engineer-focused product requirements documents optimized for TaskMaster task breakdown. Optionally executes tasks autonomously with quality control, datetime tracking, and validation checkpoints.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when user:
- Requests a PRD or product requirements document
- Says "I want a PRD", "create requirements", "write requirements"
- Mentions taskmaster or task-driven development
- Asks to document product/feature requirements for engineering

Do NOT activate for:
- Code documentation (API docs, technical reference)
- Test specifications or QA documentation
- Project management timelines without product context
- PDF document creation

## Core Principles

**Quality Over Speed**: Planning is 95% of the work. Take time to create comprehensive PRDs that enable successful implementation.

**Taskmaster Required**: This skill REQUIRES taskmaster (MCP or CLI). Will block and prompt for installation if not detected.

**Engineer-Focused**: Primary audience is engineering teams. Include technical depth, code examples, architecture considerations, and implementation details.

**Validation-Driven**: Automated checks ensure PRD quality before delivery. 13 validation checks run automatically.

**User Testing Checkpoints**: Every 5 tasks, insert user validation checkpoint to catch issues early.

**Complete Automation**: Provides 4 autonomous execution modes with git policies, progress logging, and datetime tracking.

## Workflow Overview (12 Steps)

1. **Enable Plan Mode & Check State** - Resume detection + interactive prompts
2. **Detect Existing PRD** - Smart detection with execute/update/replace options
3. **Detect Taskmaster** - MCP > CLI > Block if missing
4. **Discovery Questions** - 12+ detailed questions (if generating new PRD)
5. **Initialize Taskmaster** - Via MCP/CLI (if not already initialized)
6. **Generate PRD** - Comprehensive 11-section document (if creating new)
7. **Validate Quality** - 13 automated checks
8. **Parse & Expand** - Combined operation with research
9. **Insert User Tests** - Checkpoint every 5 tasks
10. **Setup Tracking** - DateTime, rollback, accuracy scripts
11. **Choose Next Action** - Handoff to TaskMaster OR autonomous execution
12. **Summary & Start** - Present overview and begin work

---

## Detailed Implementation

### Step 1: Enable Plan Mode & Check for Incomplete Work

**FIRST ACTION** when skill activates:

```
1. Check for incomplete work from previous session:
   - Run: python3 .taskmaster/scripts/execution-state.py (if exists)
   - If incomplete work found: Offer to resume

2. Enable plan mode (if not already enabled):
   - This ensures AskUserQuestion tool works properly
   - Inform user: "Enabling plan mode for interactive prompts..."

3. Proceed to Step 2
```

**Auto-Resume if Crash Detected:**

```
If execution-state.py reports incomplete work:

🔍 Detected incomplete work from previous session

📍 Last Activity:
  - Mode: {mode}
  - Task: {task_id}
  - Subtask: {subtask_id}
  - Last updated: {timestamp}
  - Completed: Tasks {completed_list}

Resume from:
  1. Last subtask (continue where crashed)
  2. Restart current task
  3. Last checkpoint
  4. Start fresh

Type: 1, 2, 3, or 4
```

---

### Step 2: Detect Existing PRD (Smart Detection)

**SECOND ACTION**: Check if PRD already exists before generating new one.

**Detection Logic:**

```
1. Check if .taskmaster/ exists:
   - Use Glob: .taskmaster/
   - NO → New project, proceed to Step 3 (detect taskmaster)
   - YES → Continue to check for PRD

2. Check for existing PRD:
   - Use Glob: .taskmaster/docs/*.md or .taskmaster/docs/prd.*
   - Read .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json to get task count and status
   - Found PRD → Show existing PRD options (below)
   - No PRD → Proceed to Step 3 (detect taskmaster)
```

**If Existing PRD Found:**

```
🔍 Found existing PRD: {filename}

📄 PRD Details:
  - Created: {date from file}
  - Location: .taskmaster/docs/{filename}
  - Tasks: {X total} ({Y completed}, {Z pending})
  - Status: {% complete}

What would you like to do?

  1. Execute tasks from existing PRD
     → Skip to Step 11 (choose execution mode)
     → Start working on pending tasks

  2. Update/refine existing PRD
     → Edit current PRD with new requirements
     → Re-parse to update tasks
     → Merge with existing task list

  3. Create new PRD (replace current)
     → Confirm: "This will replace existing PRD. Continue?"
     → Proceed to Step 3 (full PRD generation workflow)

  4. Review existing PRD
     → Show summary of current PRD
     → Display task breakdown
     → Exit skill

Type: 1, 2, 3, or 4
```

**Option 1: Execute Existing Tasks**
```
User selects: 1

✅ Using existing PRD: {filename}
📋 Remaining tasks: {Z} pending tasks
📍 Next checkpoint: {next USER-TEST}

→ Skip to Step 11 (choose execution mode)
```

**Option 2: Update Existing PRD**
```
User selects: 2

📝 What changes would you like to make?

[User provides changes]

✅ Updating PRD...
→ Edit existing PRD file with changes
→ Re-run parse-prd with --append flag
→ Continue to Step 8 (insert user tests for new tasks only)
→ Proceed to Step 11
```

**Option 3: Replace PRD**
```
User selects: 3

⚠️  WARNING: This will replace your existing PRD and task list.

Current work:
  - {Y} tasks completed
  - {Z} tasks pending
  - All completed work will be preserved in git history
  - Task files will be regenerated

Type "yes" to confirm replacement, or "no" to cancel.

[If yes]
✅ Creating new PRD (old PRD backed up to .taskmaster/docs/prd-backup-{timestamp}.md)
→ Proceed to Step 3 (full workflow)
```

**Option 4: Review**
```
User selects: 4

📄 Current PRD Summary:
  - Title: {title}
  - Created: {date}
  - Goals: {list top 3 goals}
  - Requirements: {count functional requirements}
  - Tasks: {X total} ({Y completed}, {Z pending})

[Display executive summary and key sections]

✅ Review complete. Skill exiting.
```

**If No PRD Found (but .taskmaster/ exists):**
```
🔍 Found .taskmaster/ directory (initialized)
📄 No PRD found

Creating PRD for TaskMaster...
→ Proceed to Step 3 (detect taskmaster, already initialized)
```

---

### Step 3: Detect Taskmaster (MANDATORY - Blocks if Missing)

**CRITICAL**: Must detect taskmaster BEFORE proceeding with PRD generation.

**Detection Priority:**

```
1. Check for MCP Task-Master-AI (PREFERRED):
   - Attempt: mcp__task-master-ai__get_tasks with projectRoot
   - If successful: TASKMASTER_METHOD="MCP" ✅
   - Note: MCP provides superior integration (direct function calls)

2. Fallback to CLI:
   - Run: which taskmaster
   - Run: taskmaster --version
   - If found: TASKMASTER_METHOD="CLI" ✅

3. Neither Available:
   - TASKMASTER_METHOD="NONE" ❌
   - BLOCK and display installation instructions
```

**If Taskmaster Not Found:**

```
⚠️ Taskmaster Required

This skill REQUIRES taskmaster (MCP or CLI) to function properly.

I didn't detect taskmaster in your environment.

Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Install MCP Task-Master-AI
  • Add to Claude Code MCP settings
  • Provides seamless integration with direct function calls
  • See: https://github.com/cyanheads/task-master-ai
  • Installation: Add to your MCP config, restart Claude Code

Option 2: Install CLI
  • Run: npm install -g task-master-ai
  • Use command-line interface
  • See: https://github.com/cyanheads/task-master-ai

Please install taskmaster and type 'done' when ready.

[WAIT for user to install and confirm]
[RE-DETECT after user confirms]
[PROCEED only if detection successful]
```

**NO PROCEEDING WITHOUT TASKMASTER DETECTED**

---

### Step 4: Discovery (Comprehensive Requirements Gathering)

Ask detailed questions to ensure comprehensive PRD:

**Essential Questions (5):**
1. What problem does this solve? (user pain point, business impact)
2. Who is the target user/audience?
3. What is the proposed solution or feature?
4. What are the key success metrics? (how we measure success)
5. What constraints exist? (technical, timeline, resources)

**Technical Context (4):**
6. Is this for an existing codebase or greenfield project?
7. What tech stack? (if known)
8. Any integration requirements? (third-party services, internal systems)
9. Performance/scale requirements? (users, data volume, latency)

**Taskmaster Specific (3):**
10. Have you used taskmaster before? (helps calibrate detail level)
11. What's the estimated complexity? (simple feature, typical project, complex system)
12. Timeline expectations? (helps with phasing and task breakdown)

**Open-Ended (1):**
13. Anything else I should know? (edge cases, constraints, context)

**Smart Defaults:**
- If user provides minimal answers, use best guesses and document assumptions
- Default to comprehensive detail
- Assume engineer audience unless specified otherwise

---

### Step 5: Initialize Taskmaster Project

**CRITICAL**: Initialize ONLY via taskmaster MCP/CLI. NEVER create .taskmaster/ manually.

#### If TASKMASTER_METHOD="MCP":

```
Use mcp__task-master-ai__initialize_project:
  - projectRoot: ${PWD} (absolute path)
  - yes: true (skip prompts)
  - storeTasksInGit: true
  - initGit: false (if git already exists)
  - skipInstall: false
  - rules: ["claude"]

Result: .taskmaster/ structure created by taskmaster
```

#### If TASKMASTER_METHOD="CLI":

```bash
taskmaster init --yes --store-tasks-in-git --rules=claude
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Taskmaster Initialized
   Created: .taskmaster/docs/
   Created: .taskmaster/tasks/
   Created: .taskmaster/reports/
   Created: .taskmaster/state/
   Updated: .gitignore
```

---

### Step 6: Generate Comprehensive PRD

Write PRD to `.taskmaster/docs/prd.md`

**11 Essential Sections:**

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences: problem + solution + impact)

2. **Problem Statement**
   - Current situation and pain points
   - User impact (who's affected, how)
   - Business impact (cost, opportunity)
   - Why solve this now

3. **Goals & Success Metrics** (SMART format)
   - 3-5 specific goals
   - Each with: metric, baseline, target, timeframe
   - Example: "Increase user activation from 45% to 65% within 3 months"

4. **User Stories** (Agile format with taskmaster focus)
   - As a [user], I want to [action] so that I can [benefit]
   - Detailed acceptance criteria (becomes task completion criteria)
   - Each story suggests 1-3 implementation tasks

5. **Functional Requirements**
   - Numbered (REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.)
   - Prioritized (Must/Should/Could have)
   - Each requirement is atomic and testable
   - Includes implementation hints for task breakdown

6. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance (with specific targets: "< 200ms p95")
   - Security (authentication, encryption, compliance)
   - Scalability (user load, data volume)
   - Reliability (uptime, error rates)
   - Accessibility (WCAG standards)
   - Compatibility (browsers, devices, OS)

7. **Technical Considerations**
   - Architecture implications
   - API specifications (with request/response examples)
   - Database schema changes (with SQL/schema examples)
   - Dependencies (internal and external)
   - Migration strategy (for existing systems)
   - Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)

8. **Implementation Roadmap** (Taskmaster Optimization)
   - Phase breakdown (Phase 1, 2, 3...)
   - Task sequencing (what depends on what)
   - Complexity estimates (for taskmaster scheduling)
   - Suggested task breakdown per requirement

9. **Out of Scope**
   - Explicitly list what will NOT be included
   - Prevents scope creep
   - Note future considerations

10. **Open Questions & Risks**
    - Unresolved decisions with owners
    - Known risks with mitigation strategies
    - Areas needing further research

11. **Validation Checkpoints**
    - Milestones where we verify progress
    - Quality gates for task completion

---

### Step 7: Validate PRD Quality (13 Automated Checks)

**Required Elements (5 checks):**
1. ✅ Executive summary exists (2-3 sentences)
2. ✅ Problem statement includes user AND business impact
3. ✅ All goals have SMART metrics (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
4. ✅ User stories have acceptance criteria (minimum 3 per story)
5. ✅ Out of scope explicitly defined

**Functional Requirements (3 checks):**
6. ✅ All functional requirements are testable (not vague)
7. ✅ Each requirement has priority (Must/Should/Could)
8. ✅ Requirements are numbered (REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.)

**Technical Considerations (2 checks):**
9. ✅ Technical considerations address architecture
10. ✅ Non-functional requirements include specific targets (not "fast" but "< 200ms p95")

**Taskmaster-Specific (3 checks):**
11. ✅ Requirements have task breakdown hints
12. ✅ Dependencies identified for task sequencing
13. ✅ Acceptance criteria are concrete (can become task completion checks)

**Validation Output:**
```
✅ PRD Quality Validation: 13/13 PASSED
  ✅ All required elements present
  ✅ All functional requirements testable
  ✅ Taskmaster optimization complete

Quality Score: 60/60 (EXCELLENT)
Safe to proceed with task generation.

OR

⚠️ PRD Quality Validation: 11/13 (2 warnings)
  ✅ Required elements: 5/5
  ✅ Functional requirements: 3/3
  ✅ Technical considerations: 2/2
  ⚠️ Taskmaster optimization: 1/3

  Warnings:
    - REQ-007: "should be performant" is vague
      Suggestion: Replace with "< 200ms response time for 95th percentile"
    - User Story 2: Only 2 acceptance criteria (minimum 3 recommended)
      Suggestion: Add edge case criterion

Quality Score: 55/60 (GOOD - minor improvements suggested)
```

---

### Step 8: Parse PRD & Expand Tasks (Single Combined Operation)

**IMPORTANT**: Combine parse-prd + expand-all with research into ONE operation.

**Auto-Calculate Task Count:**
```
numTasks = (count of functional requirements × 1.5) rounded
Minimum: 10 tasks
Maximum: 40 tasks
```

#### If TASKMASTER_METHOD="MCP":

```
1. Parse PRD with research:
   Use mcp__task-master-ai__parse_prd:
     - projectRoot: ${PWD}
     - input: ".taskmaster/docs/prd.md"
     - numTasks: Auto-calculated based on requirements count
     - research: true (ALWAYS use research for better quality)
     - append: false

2. Immediately expand ALL tasks with research:
   Use mcp__task-master-ai__expand_all:
     - projectRoot: ${PWD}
     - research: true (ALWAYS use research)
     - force: false
```

#### If TASKMASTER_METHOD="CLI":

```bash
# Combined operation:
taskmaster parse-prd --input .taskmaster/docs/prd.md --research --num-tasks auto && \
taskmaster expand-all --research
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Tasks Generated: 22 tasks from PRD
✅ Tasks Expanded: 94 subtasks created
  - Phase 1: 5 tasks, 18 subtasks
  - Phase 2: 6 tasks, 28 subtasks
  - Phase 3: 5 tasks, 22 subtasks
  - Phase 4: 4 tasks, 18 subtasks
  - Phase 5: 2 tasks, 8 subtasks
```

---

### Step 9: Insert User Testing Tasks (Every 5 Tasks)

**CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT**: After tasks are expanded, insert user-facing testing tasks.

**Logic:**
```
For every 5 tasks:
  - Insert a new task: "USER-TEST-{N}"
  - Title: "User Validation Checkpoint {N}"
  - Description: "Manually test functionality from Tasks {start} to {end}"

Example:
  - TASK-001 to TASK-005 → Insert USER-TEST-1 after TASK-005
  - TASK-006 to TASK-010 → Insert USER-TEST-2 after TASK-010
```

**User Testing Task Template:**

```markdown
# USER-TEST-{N}: User Validation Checkpoint {N}

## Purpose
Manual testing of functionality implemented in Tasks {start}-{end}

## Prerequisites
All subtasks in Tasks {start}-{end} must be completed and merged to main branch.

## Testing Checklist

### Functionality Tests
[For each requirement covered in these 5 tasks, add:]
- [ ] Test Requirement REQ-{X}: [Description]
  - Expected: [What should happen]
  - Actual: [User fills in]

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test integration between components
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing features

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure response time (should be < [target])
- [ ] Test under expected load

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ All functionality tests pass
- ✅ No critical bugs found
- ✅ Performance meets targets

## If Tests Fail
1. Document issue in .taskmaster/docs/progress.md
2. Type "issues" and describe what failed
3. I'll create fix tasks before proceeding
4. Do NOT continue to next tasks until fixed

## When Complete
Type "passed" to continue to next tasks.
```

**Implementation:**

#### If TASKMASTER_METHOD="MCP":
```
Use mcp__task-master-ai__add_task for each checkpoint:
  - projectRoot: ${PWD}
  - title: "User Validation Checkpoint {N}"
  - description: "Manually test functionality from Tasks {start} to {end}"
  - details: [Full testing checklist template above]
  - dependencies: "{end}" (depends on last task in group)
  - priority: "high"
```

#### If TASKMASTER_METHOD="CLI":
```bash
taskmaster add-task \
  --title="User Validation Checkpoint {N}" \
  --description="Manual testing checkpoint" \
  --dependencies="{end}" \
  --priority=high
```

**Result:**
```
✨ Inserted user validation checkpoints:
   ✅ USER-TEST-1 (after Task 5)
   ✅ USER-TEST-2 (after Task 10)
   ✅ USER-TEST-3 (after Task 15)
   ✅ USER-TEST-4 (after Task 20)

📊 Updated task count: 26 tasks (22 implementation + 4 user tests)
```

---

### Step 10: Setup Tracking Scripts

Create automation scripts in `.taskmaster/scripts/`:

**Scripts to Create:**

1. **track-time.py** - Real datetime tracking with UTC timestamps
2. **rollback.sh** - Git rollback to any task checkpoint
3. **learn-accuracy.py** - Estimation accuracy learning
4. **security-audit.py** - Auto-generate security checklist
5. **execution-state.py** - Crash recovery state management

**All scripts are included in this skill's implementation and will be auto-generated.**

See sections below for complete script implementations.

---

---

### Step 11: Choose Next Action (Handoff vs Autonomous Execution)

**CRITICAL CHOICE**: After PRD and tasks are ready, ask user how they want to proceed.

**Use AskUserQuestion tool** to present two main options:

```
Use AskUserQuestion:

questions:
  - question: "Your PRD and tasks are ready. How would you like to proceed?"
    header: "Next Action"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "Show TaskMaster Commands"
        description: "Hand off to TaskMaster. I'll show you the commands to run tasks manually. Full control."

      - label: "Autonomous Execution"
        description: "I'll execute tasks for you autonomously with 4 execution modes to choose from."
```

**Option A: Handoff to TaskMaster (DEFAULT)**

If user selects "Show TaskMaster Commands":

```
✅ PRD Complete: .taskmaster/docs/prd.md
📋 Tasks Ready: {X} tasks ({Y} subtasks)
📍 Next checkpoint: {next USER-TEST}

🚀 TaskMaster Commands (Use these to work on tasks):

Sequential Execution:
  taskmaster next-task        # Get next available task
  taskmaster get-task {id}    # Work on specific task
  taskmaster set-task-status {id} --status=done

Parallel Execution (for independent tasks):
  taskmaster get-tasks --status=pending --with-subtasks
  # Work on multiple tasks simultaneously

Progress Tracking:
  taskmaster get-tasks --with-subtasks    # See all tasks
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py start {task_id}
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py complete {task_id}

Quality & Safety:
  bash .taskmaster/scripts/rollback.sh {task_id}    # Rollback to checkpoint
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/security-audit.py     # Security check

📚 Documentation:
  - PRD: .taskmaster/docs/prd.md
  - Tasks: .taskmaster/tasks/
  - Progress: .taskmaster/docs/progress.md

💡 Tip: Use TaskMaster MCP tools for the best experience!

Ready to start? Run: taskmaster next-task
```

Then EXIT the skill (skill complete).

---

**Option B: Autonomous Execution**

If user selects "Autonomous Execution":

Ask follow-up question with 4 execution modes:

```
Use AskUserQuestion:

questions:
  - question: "Select autonomous execution mode:"
    header: "Execution Mode"
    multiSelect: false
    options:
      - label: "Sequential to Checkpoint"
        description: "Work autonomously until next user test. Stops for validation. RECOMMENDED for quality control."

      - label: "Parallel to Checkpoint"
        description: "Run independent tasks in parallel until next user test. Faster execution."

      - label: "Full Autonomous"
        description: "Run ALL tasks in parallel without stopping. ⚠️ Skips user validation."

      - label: "Manual Control"
        description: "You decide which tasks to run. Full control over execution."
```

**Execution Mode Details:**

**Mode 1: Sequential to Checkpoint**
- Executes tasks one-by-one until next USER-TEST
- Stops for user validation
- Best for quality control
- RECOMMENDED for first-time features

**Mode 2: Parallel to Checkpoint**
- Executes independent tasks in parallel
- Stops at next USER-TEST
- Faster execution
- Good for experienced users

**Mode 3: Full Autonomous**
- Runs ALL tasks in parallel without stopping
- Auto-completes USER-TEST tasks
- Fastest execution
- WARNING: Skips manual validation

**Mode 4: Manual Control**
- User decides which tasks to run
- Full control over execution
- No autonomous execution

**All execution modes include:**
- Strict git branching policies (branch per task, sub-branch per subtask)
- Commit checkpoints after every task
- Progress logging to .taskmaster/docs/progress.md
- Datetime tracking with track-time.py
- Autonomous execution (no user input except at checkpoints)

**After mode selected:**

1. Store their selection
2. Output the corresponding full execution prompt
3. Recognize if user types "begin" or "start"
4. Begin autonomous execution

**Claude Recommendation:**

Based on context, recommend the best option:
- First-time feature OR critical system → Mode 1 (Sequential)
- Experienced user OR non-critical → Mode 2 (Parallel)
- Trusted implementation OR time-critical → Mode 3 (Full)
- Complex requirements OR learning → Mode 4 (Manual)

Display recommendation: "⭐ Claude Recommends: Mode {N}"

See full execution prompt templates in "EXECUTION PROMPT TEMPLATES" section below.

## EXECUTION PROMPT TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Sequential to Checkpoint

```
Execute tasks sequentially from {current_task} until USER-TEST-{N}.

DATETIME TRACKING:
Before each task:
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py start {task_id}
Before each subtask:
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py start {task_id} {subtask_id}
After each subtask:
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py complete {task_id} {subtask_id}
After each task:
  python3 .taskmaster/scripts/track-time.py complete {task_id}

STRICT GIT POLICY:
1. When starting a task:
   - Create feature branch: git checkout -b task-{id}-{slug}

2. For each subtask:
   - Create sub-branch: git checkout -b task-{id}-subtask-{n}
   - Complete subtask implementation
   - Run tests
   - Commit: git commit -m "Complete task-{id} subtask-{n}: [description]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   - Merge to task branch: git checkout task-{id}-{slug} && git merge task-{id}-subtask-{n}
   - Delete sub-branch: git branch -d task-{id}-subtask-{n}

3. When task complete:
   - Verify ALL subtasks merged
   - Merge to main: git checkout main && git merge task-{id}-{slug}
   - Create checkpoint tag: git tag -a checkpoint-task-{id} -m "Completed task {id}"
   - Delete feature branch: git branch -d task-{id}-{slug}

PROGRESS LOGGING:
After EVERY task completion, append to .taskmaster/docs/progress.md:

## Task {id}: {title} - COMPLETED
**Completed**: {timestamp}
**Duration**: {actual_minutes} min (estimated: {estimated_minutes} min)
**Subtasks**: {n} completed
**Tests**: {pass/fail}
**Issues**: {any issues encountered}
**Git**: Merged to main, tagged as checkpoint-task-{id}

AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION RULES:
- Do NOT ask user for input unless critical error
- If task fails tests: retry once, then log and skip
- If dependency missing: log and skip
- Continue until USER-TEST-{N} reached
- Update execution state after each task

ROLLBACK SUPPORT:
If user types "rollback to task X" at ANY TIME:
  1. STOP current work immediately
  2. Run: bash .taskmaster/scripts/rollback.sh X
  3. Wait for user confirmation
  4. Resume as user directs

WHEN COMPLETE:
Stop and report:
"✅ Tasks {start}-{end} completed
📋 Next: USER-TEST-{N} - User validation required
📝 Progress: .taskmaster/docs/progress.md
🌳 Git: All tasks merged with checkpoints"
```

---

### Template 2: Parallel to Checkpoint

Similar to Template 1 but with:
- Launch up to 3 concurrent tasks
- Handle merge conflicts automatically
- Wait for dependencies before starting dependent tasks
- All tasks still follow git policy (branch per task)

---

### Template 3: Full Autonomous

Similar to Template 2 but:
- No stops for USER-TEST (auto-completes them)
- Maximum parallelization (up to 5 concurrent)
- Runs automated tests for USER-TEST tasks
- Only stops when ALL tasks complete

---

### Template 4: Manual Control

```
Awaiting user commands:
- "next task" - Get next task
- "task {id}" - Work on specific task
- "status" - Show progress
- "parallel {id1,id2}" - Run specific tasks in parallel

Git policies enforced.
Progress logged to progress.md.
Datetime tracking active.
```

## Tips for Best Results

**Understand the Workflow:**
- This skill PRIMARILY generates PRDs (with optional execution)
- If you already have a PRD, the skill will detect it and offer options
- Default behavior: Generate PRD → Hand off to TaskMaster
- Optional: Choose autonomous execution after PRD is ready

**Provide Context Upfront:**
- More detail in discovery → Better PRD
- Share constraints, dependencies, assumptions
- Mention existing systems to integrate with

**Be Specific About Success:**
- Quantify goals (not "improve UX" but "increase NPS from 45 to 60")
- Define what "done" looks like
- Specify how you'll measure success

**Choose the Right Path:**
- **Handoff to TaskMaster** (Default): Best if you want full control
- **Autonomous Execution**: Best if you trust the process and want speed
  - Sequential to Checkpoint: Quality-focused, stops for validation
  - Parallel to Checkpoint: Faster, stops at checkpoints
  - Full Autonomous: Maximum speed, skips validation
  - Manual Control: You decide every step

**If Using Existing PRD:**
- Option 1: Execute tasks (pick up where you left off)
- Option 2: Update PRD (add new requirements)
- Option 3: Replace PRD (start fresh, old PRD backed up)
- Option 4: Review PRD (just read it)

**Leverage Automation (if using autonomous execution):**
- Use datetime tracking to improve estimates
- Use rollback if you need to undo work
- Let accuracy learning adjust your estimates
- Review security audit before deployment

**Trust the Process:**
- USER-TEST checkpoints catch issues early
- Git checkpoints allow easy rollback
- Progress.md shows exactly what happened
- TaskMaster integration ensures smooth workflow

---

**Remember**: A comprehensive PRD with automated quality control and TaskMaster integration is the foundation of successful implementation. This skill focuses on creating that foundation. Execution is optional - you can always hand off to TaskMaster for more control.
