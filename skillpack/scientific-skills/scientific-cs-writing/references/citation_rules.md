# Citation Hygiene Rules

- Never invent citations or DOIs.
- If metadata is missing, explicitly request DOI/URL/arXiv ID and mark as TODO.
- Keep a single canonical bibliography file: `refs/references.bib`.
- Prefer deterministic citation keys (e.g., `AuthorYearKeyword`).
- Record provenance: for each key paper, store where it was found (URL/DOI).
