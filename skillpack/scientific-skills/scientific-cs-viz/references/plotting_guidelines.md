# Plotting Guidelines (Publication-oriented)

- Use consistent fonts/sizes across figures.
- Always label axes + units; include legend only if needed.
- Save as PNG for quick review; use SVG/PDF for publication if requested.
- Use deterministic color palettes; avoid rainbow unless meaningful.
- Prefer small multiples over overcrowded single plots.
