# Imaging EDA Checklist

- File inventory: count, extensions, total size
- Metadata summary (per modality/file type)
- Pixel statistics: dtype, min/max, percentiles (sampled)
- Visualization: representative slices/tiles + histogram
- Data issues: missing tags, compression, corrupted files, inconsistent spacing
- Next-step recommendation: classical CV vs deep learning vs graph/spatial workflows
