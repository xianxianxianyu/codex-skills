# QA Triage Guide

## Keep in QA

- Definition or explanation requests
- Short comparison with minimal context
- Quick recommendation with clear constraints
- Clarify a term or acronym

## Escalate to Requirements (L1)

- User asks for a PRD, requirements, spec, or proposal
- Needs scope, acceptance criteria, or structured documentation

## Escalate to Feasibility (L2)

- User asks "is this feasible", "how long", "how much", or "compare approaches"
- Needs cost, timeline, risk, or dependency analysis

## Escalate to Code (L3)

- User asks to implement, modify, or debug code
- User requests tests, refactors, or repo changes

## If Ambiguous

- Ask one clarifying question: "Do you want a quick answer or a full document/analysis?"
